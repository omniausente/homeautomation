Home Automation Project

This is where I'll hold all functional and technical information regarding the home automation project I'll be initializing in the next few months.

Although this is an hobby I have, I'll try to make it as much professional as I can. Having that in mind I'm planning to strictly follow the regular waterfall project phases:
  1. Feasibility
  2. High-Level Design
  3. Low-Level Design
  4. Build and Unit Testing
  5. Deployment
